The annual Vineyard Square HOA meeting was held at the Chapel Hill Public Library on Wednesday, February 5th.  
The meeting agenda followed the expected format. 
During the election of offiers, no nominations came forth. Worried about the number of volunteer Board members serving the Association, I nominated myself and glad I did. 
Turns out I was the only homeowner to volunteer to serve on the Board. 

After my brief introduction to the members in attenance, the nomination was placed to the vote. 
Homeowners voted unanimously in favor of my joining the Vineyard Square Board.
