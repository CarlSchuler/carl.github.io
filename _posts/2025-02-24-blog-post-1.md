The annual Vineyard Square HOA meeting was held at the Chapel Hill Public Library on Wednesday, February 5th, 2025.
The meeting followed the agenda mailed to homeowners earlier this year. 
During the election of offiers nominations did not come forth. 
Worried about dwindling volunteer Board members, I nominated myself.
Turns out I was the only homeowner to volunteer. 
After my brief introduction to the members in attendance, the nomination came to the vote. 
Homeowners voted unanimously in favor of the self-nomination to the Vineyard Square Board.
