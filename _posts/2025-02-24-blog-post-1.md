The annual Vineyard Square HOA meeting was held at the Chapel Hill Public Library on Wednesday, February 5th.  
The meeting agenda followed the expected format. 
During the election of offiers, no nominations came forth. Worried about the number of volunteer Board , I nominated myself and I'm glad I did. It turns out that I was the only homeowner to volunteer to serve on the Board. 
After my brief introduction, the nomination was placed to the vote. The homeowners in attendenca unanimuously voted me to join the all-volunteer Vineyard Square Board.
