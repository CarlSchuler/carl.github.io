Vineyard Square homeowner and resident of the community for 20 years:


Served on Vineyard Square HOA for 7 years from 2005-2012


Appointed by the Town of Chapel Hill Town Council to the Board of Adjustment and served two terms.


Why I made self-nomination during the February 5th,annual HOA meeting?
======
During the annual meeting, the floor opened to HOA Board nominations and no one volunteered to serve.

Sensing this portion of the meeting would soon close, I nominated myself for consideration.   After a brief introduction,members in attendance voted on my self-nomination.  

Homeowners voted unanimousely for my appointment.  As a result of the annual meeting,it was known that at least three homweowners would serve on Board. 

My positions:
======
1. I beleive a fully staffed Board of five homeowners leads to better discussions resulting in fully informed decisions about the direction of the Vineyard Square Association. 
2. Ensure sufficient reserves to support an aging infrastruture managed by the Association. 
3. Proactively review Association finances to support current and future expenditurs.  Raising HOA fees-as stipulated in the Convenence to minimize the possibiity of a levied assessment to all 191 homeowners within Vineyard Square.
4. Find ways to maximize the rate of return on Association savings.
5. Transparency: respond to homeowners' concerns promptly (i.e: reply to emails within a 48 hour period).
